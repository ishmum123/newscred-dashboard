This is a simple React Application based upon the data provided at - https://api.covid19api.com/

The API fetches data of March-April 2020 but it can be easily extended to provide current data. Most of the functionalities has been tested through automated and manual testing which should make it fairly easy to understand and extend. Anything not 'purely react' has been mocked during testing for stable test results.
 
p.s. - The API calls have not been mocked in e2e tests as they are not `DEADLY` operations
